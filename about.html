  <h4>
    We Bring preventive dental care with compassion and comfort for those with
    limited access to care.
  </h4>
  <p>
    Visiting Dental Hygiene, Inc. is a non-profit, 501(c) (3), mobile dental
    hygiene program comprised of Public Health Dental Hygienists. This company
    is focused on providing preventive oral health care services in homeless
    shelters, nursing homes, schools, and other nontraditional settings. In
    2013, Emma Lawson had a vision to bring oral health care to those in
    underserved populations. These services include dental screenings, oral
    cancer screenings, oral hygiene instructions, dental cleanings, fluoride
    treatments, dental sealants, and dental referrals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the VDH, Inc team is to make dentistry as comfortable and
    compassionate as it can possibly be. They also strive to build trusting
    relationships with each person in their care. With this philosophy in mind,
    they can provide their patients with exceptional dental care and enhance
    their overall quality of life. Education is a key component to our services.
    The dental education which we provide to each patient helps them to
    understand the link between good oral health and whole body health.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Mass Health provider we are able to direct bill for those patients with
    Mass health insurance. We are also able to accept private pay for patients
    without Mass Health. Many uninsured patients are provided with preventive
    dental hygiene care every week by Visiting Dental Hygiene, Inc. VDH, Inc
    provides care to a diversity of facilities and a broad geographic area,
    which sets us apart from all other public health dental hygiene practices.

  <h3>What is a Public Health Hygienist?</h3>
  <p>
    A public health dental hygienist is a practicing registered dental hygienist
    who may perform dental hygiene procedures in a public health setting or in
    home bound settings without the supervision or direction of a dentist.
